ActiveMQ TextMessage Recorder
=============================

Trying out rx.scala Observables. Currently creates an observable for an ActiveMQ topic and a subscriber that writes out the messages from the observable as JSON. Will eventually add "replay" functionality, so that this application can be used to backup ActiveMQ messages.
